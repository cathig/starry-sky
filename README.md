# Starry Sky
Welcome to Starry Sky!

In this exercise from _Python Crash Course_ 2nd Ed (Chapter 13 p. 264), I practiced using pygame to randomly place objects on a game surface.

## How to use
1. Run starry_sky.py.

   A game window with randomly-placed stars opens.

2. Close the game window with the Close (X) button or press 'q'.
